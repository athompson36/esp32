# Cursor rules for this project

You are working on a Meshtastic firmware fork.

Priorities:
1) Add a new PlatformIO environment named `tbeam-1w`.
2) Add a new board variant under `variants/tbeam_1w/`.
3) Keep changes minimal and isolated: avoid editing unrelated code.
4) Prefer compile-time flags (`#define`) over runtime detection.
5) Do not assume GPIO pins—only use pins explicitly provided in `docs/TBEAM_1W_PINMAP.md`.
6) Provide clear build + flash commands in docs when you change something.

Quality:
- Must build on macOS with PlatformIO Core.
- Avoid breaking upstream formatting/style.
