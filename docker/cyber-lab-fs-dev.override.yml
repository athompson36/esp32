# Override for fs-dev: pass webcam and USB serial into the web container.
# Use with: docker compose -f docker/cyber-lab-compose.yml -f docker/cyber-lab-fs-dev.override.yml up -d
#
# To add USB serial devices (for flashing), add lines under devices for each present port, e.g.:
#   - /dev/ttyUSB0:/dev/ttyUSB0
#   - /dev/ttyACM0:/dev/ttyACM0
# The deploy script can generate an override that includes only existing devices.
# group_add: ["44"] = host's "video" group so the container can open /dev/video0.
