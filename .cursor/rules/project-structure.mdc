# Keep PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md updated

**PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md** at the repo root is the single reference for repo layout, conventions, stacks, and dependencies. **Update it** whenever you:

- **Add a feature** that introduces new directories, services, or entry points.
- **Change repo structure** (new top-level dirs, moved files, new config locations).
- **Add or remove dependencies** (e.g. requirements.txt, package.json, new system deps in Dockerfiles).
- **Change conventions** (naming, where things live, how to run or build something).
- **Add or change Docker images** (new Dockerfile or compose service, env vars, ports).

## What to update

- **Section 2 (Directory structure):** Add or rename dirs/files that are part of the canonical layout.
- **Section 3 (Conventions):** Adjust if naming or workflow rules change.
- **Section 4 (Stacks):** Add a stack or change runtime/entry.
- **Section 5 (Libraries and dependencies):** Update when requirements.txt, package.json, or other dep lists change.
- **Section 6 (Docker):** Add images, compose paths, or restart/port details.
- **Section 7 (Key config and env):** New env vars or config files.
- **Section 8 (Last updated):** Note what changed and when (brief line is enough).

You don’t need to edit PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md for tiny typo fixes or comments; focus on layout, conventions, stacks, and dependencies.
